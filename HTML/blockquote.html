			<p>
				A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of 
				arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, 
				the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conventionally, a computer consists of at last one processing element, typically a central 
				processing unit (CPU) and some form of memory. The processing element carries out arithmetic 
				and login operations, and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of 
				operations based on stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved 
				from a external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.
